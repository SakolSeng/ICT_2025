*Here are clear instructions for students on how to fork a repository on GitHub for the first time:
	1.	Navigate to the GitHub repository you want to fork using the search bar or directly by URL.
	2.	On the repository page, locate the “Fork” button in the upper-right corner.
	3.	Click the “Fork” button. GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. If you belong to multiple organizations, select where you want to fork it (usually your personal account).
	4.	After the repository is forked, you now have your own copy under your GitHub profile.
	5.	To work on the fork locally on your computer, copy the URL of your forked repository (choose HTTPS or SSH).
	6.	Open your terminal or command line and type:

git clone <your-forked-repository-url>
This downloads the forked repository to your local machine.
	7.	Navigate into the cloned repository directory:

cd <repository-name>
By following these steps, students can fork any public GitHub repository, clone it locally for development, and sync it with the original repo later if needed. Forking is a great way to safely experiment, contribute, and manage your own copy of open-source projects.
